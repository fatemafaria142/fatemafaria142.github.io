My research works are intended to tackle low resource NLP, covering areas like <em>natural language generation</em>, <em>summarization</em>, <em>question answering (QA)</em>, 
and <em>interpretability of language models</em>. I have utilized cutting-edge techniques like <em>generative</em> and 
<em>contrastive learning</em> to improve language generation and <em>representation learning</em> for low resource language. 
Additionally, I have applied natural language processing in specific <em>software engineering (SE)</em> tasks. At present, I am investigating bias, fairness and adversarial robustness in PLMs and LLMs.
<span style="color:green;"><em>I am open to the possibility of collaboration. Feel free to email.</em></span>

My research focuses on <em>Medical Image Analysis</em>, <em>Computer Vision</em>, and the application of <em>Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs)</em> and <em>Multimodal Deep Learning</em>. I have also worked extensively with <em>Natural Language Processing (NLP)</em>, particularly in areas like <em>Natural Language Generation</em> and the use of <em>Large Language Models (LLMs)</em>. My work leverages advanced <em>Deep Learning</em> techniques and explores their applications across various domains, including <em>Explainable Artificial Intelligence (XAI)</em>. Currently, I am interested in integrating these technologies to enhance machine learning applications and create innovative solutions.
